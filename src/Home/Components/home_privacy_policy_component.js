        Welcome to Bloomfields Wellness Institute. This form will provide
        information about our services and about your rights and
        responsibilities as a client. Please be sure to discuss any questions
        with your clinician or his/her Supervisor. Your signature at the bottom
        indicates that you understand the information and freely consent to
        participate in this assessment. The clinic is a training facility. Our
        students are under the supervision of our program faculty who are
        licensed psychologists with expertise in psychological, educational, and
        cognitive assessment. In order to ensure the best possible service, your
        clinician will be discussing your testing results with her/his
        supervisor(s).
      </p>
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Through the use of a variety of standard psychological tests, we will
        attempt to answer the questions that have brought you for this
        assessment. These questions generally concern learning disabilities,
        academic functioning, personality functioning, or coping styles.
        Throughout the assessment process you have the right to inquire about
        the nature or purpose of all procedures. You also have the right to know
        the test results, interpretations, and recommendations. The assessment
        process generally involves an informational interview followed by the
        administration of one or more educational and/or psychological tests.
        Although it is sometimes possible to complete the testing procedure in
        one sitting, it is common for people to be asked to return for another
        session to finish the assessment battery. Once testing is completed, the
        data will be analyzed and a report will be written. You will then have
        the opportunity to meet with your clinician to discuss the results and
        receive a copy of the report. Because we are a training clinic, our
        general turnaround time for completed reports is about 2-3 weeks.

      <h2>Counseling/Pyschotherapy</h2>
      <p>
        it is a confidential process designed to help you address your concerns,
        come to a greater understanding of yourself, and learn effective
        personal and interpersonal coping strategies. It involves a relationship
        between you and a trained therapist who has the desire and willingness
        to help you accomplish your individual goals. Counseling involves
        sharing sensitive, personal, and private information that may at times
        be distressing. During the course of counseling, there may be periods of
        increased anxiety or confusion. The outcome of counseling is often
        positive; however, the level of satisfaction for any individual is not
        predictable. Your therapist is available to support you throughout the
        counseling process.
      </p>
      <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        All interactions with Counseling Services, including scheduling of or
        attendance at appointments, content of your sessions, progress in
        counseling, and your records are confidential. BWI uses a secured online
        software to record the summary of counseling and psychotherapy sessions
        for easy access. No record of counseling is contained in any academic,
        educational, or job placement file. You may request in writing that the
        counseling staff release specific information about your counseling to
        persons you designate.
      </p>
      <h2>Exceptions to Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        <ul className="list-disc">
          <li className="pt-1">
            The counseling staff works as a team. Your therapist may consult
            with other counseling staff to provide the best possible care. These
            consultations are for professional and training purposes.
          </li>
          <li className="pt-3">
            If there is evidence of clear and imminent danger of harm to self
            and/or others, a therapist is legally and ethically required to
            report this information to the authorities responsible for ensuring
            safety. The authorities involved may include the immediate family of
            the client.
          </li>
          <li className="pt-3">
            Philippine law requires that staff of Counseling Services who learn
            of, or strongly suspect, physical or sexual abuse or neglect of any

            enforcement agencies.
